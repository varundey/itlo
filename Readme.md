# Is the lab open?
### Inspiration
So the SRM SE lab is group of around 10-15 people and there is no telling when the lab is open. Sure there is a WhatsApp group where you can ask `is the lab open?` and you can patiently wait hours till everyone reads the message and ignores you or lose your willpower to go to the lab by the time someone in the lab replies to your message.

## How to
Use `/itlo` on SRM Search Engine team on slack to check the status of the lab or `/whtk` to see who all have the keys to the lab.

## Demo
The API is powered by Django on Heroku. So you need to change the state whenver the lab opens or closes. You can also change the text field if the you have been given the key.
